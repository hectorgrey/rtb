# Rusty Terminal Browser

The Rusty Terminal Browser will be a terminal browser written in rust.  The
intention is for it to eventually be a fully featured web browser for the
terminal, but to begin with I am working on basic html parsing.

## Why?

In all honesty, I just want a better web browser for the terminal.  Given
the option, I would spend more time in the terminal than in a GUI, so I
would like a web browser capable of basic tasks like logging into Discourse
forums.
